Hi:

This is my homework1-DESIGN_PATTERNS. It contains 6 files:
1. Trade: this defines the trade class
2. TradeIterator: this is the trade iterator. Note that when the iterator iterates through an inappropriate line(like incorrect format), it just warn an error and continue rather than stop.
3. Subject: this is the subject class.
4. AverageObserver: this is the observer class which prints average price of all the trades seen thus far.
5. CurrentObserver: this is the observer class which prints the current trade
6. SubjectExample: this is the main that instantiate a subject and the two listeners and than call run.

To call the main in SubjectExample, do:
mkdir -p ./src/design_patterns
mv *.java ./src/design_patterns
javac ./src/design_patterns/*.java
java -cp ./src design_patterns.SubjectExample fileLocation

Thank you for your help.

Best,
Zhenghong Dong
